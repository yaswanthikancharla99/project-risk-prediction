# 📊 Project Risk Prediction Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

The **Project Risk Prediction Dashboard** is a frontend web application developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This dashboard helps in evaluating key project performance indicators (KPIs) and calculating a **risk score** to identify whether a project is at **Low, Medium, or High Risk**.

It provides an easy way for project managers to monitor project health and take early action to avoid failures.
